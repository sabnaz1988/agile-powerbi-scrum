## [COMMS-01] Client Kickoff Meeting
**Date:** 17/06/2026
**From:** Bash, Innovation Manager, Business Development Department, StreamFlix
**To:** DataLens Team
**Type:** Client Meeting

We're here today to discuss an exciting and urgent project to help the company transition from a free, ad-supported platform to a subscription-based service.

StreamFlix deals with all genres of films but needs to identify which ones to prioritise as we revamp our platform and systems.

We want to focus on buying films that regular users appreciate while also attracting new subscribers. As an Italian company with ambitions for global growth, we require objective data to guide our decisions. We would like actionable insights on:

- What types of films different groups of users enjoy, based on age, location, and subscription type.
- Identifying the most successful genres and movies for each audience.
- A dashboard with clear visualisations that stakeholders can easily interpret.

The timeline for this project is very tight. The revamped platform is already announced and must launch in a few weeks, so I need you to propose the first version of the project by 1st July. I'd like this meeting to be an open discussion, so feel free to ask any questions to get the information you need to get started.

## [COMMS-02] Internal – Clarifying Questions for Review
**Date:** 17/06/2026 05:00 PM
**From:** Andrew Chung `<a.chung@datalens.com>`
**To:** Bhanu Prakash `<b.prakash@datalens.com>`
**Cc:** da-team2
**Subject:** DataLens Streaming Project: Clarifying Questions for Review

Hi Bhanu,

Following the kickoff meeting with StreamFlix, we have drafted a set of clarifying questions to help us confirm the project scope and ensure our first version is aligned with the client's expectations and priorities.

Before we send anything externally, could you please review the questions below and advise if any changes are needed?

**1. Data Access and Structure**
- What is the current format and location of the user demographic, subscription, and watch history data?
- Will we be querying a database directly, or will flat files such as CSVs be provided?
- Does StreamFlix currently maintain a consolidated inventory of the film library mapped to the genres under analysis?

**2. Defining Metrics for Success**
- What is the primary measure of a successful movie or genre, such as total watch time, completion rates, or user ratings?
- Does StreamFlix already use internal performance thresholds, or should we define the bands based on the data?
- Will we have access to rights acquisition costs and historical promotional spend by title?

**3. Strategy and Dashboard Audience**
- Are there specific regions or markets we should focus on for the first iteration?
- Who are the primary stakeholders for the dashboard, and what level of detail would be most useful for them?

Once you have reviewed this, we can finalise the wording before sending it to the client.

Best regards,

Andrew Chung
DataLens Analytics Team

## [COMMS-04] Internal – Sprint 1 Backlog Shared
**Date:** 18/06/2026 11:15 AM
**From:** Bhanu Prakash `<b.prakash@datalens.com>`
**To:** da-team2
**Subject:** Re: Fwd: StreamFlix Raw Data

Dear da-team2,

I hope you are doing well.

As we commence Sprint 1, I would like to share the Sprint 1 Backlog List Document, which outlines the tasks to plan and complete plan for this sprint.

The primary objective of Sprint 1 is to establish a strong foundation for our analytics initiative by delivering the agreed backlog items within the sprint timeline. Please review the document thoroughly and ensure you have a clear understanding of your assigned tasks and dependencies.

I look forward to a productive Sprint 1 and appreciate your commitment to delivering valuable outcomes for the project.

Kind regards,

## [COMMS-05] Internal – Data Limitations and Cleaning Summary
**Date:** 19/06/2026 10:00 AM
**From:** Sabahat Naz `<s.naz@datalens.com>`
**To:** Bhanu Prakash `<b.prakash@datalens.com>`
**Cc:** da-team2
**Subject:** DataLens Streaming Project: Data Limitations and Cleaning Summary

Dear Bhanu,

Thank you for providing the raw dataset.

We have completed an initial review of the client-provided dataset. However, before we proceed further, we would like to flag an important limitation: the current dataset does not contain the user-level information required to deliver the audience-segmented insights requested in the project brief.

To meet the original client request, we would need data such as:

- user demographics, including age and location,
- subscription data, distinguishing between free and paid users,
- user-level watch history, and
- performance metrics such as ratings or completion rates.

Without this information, our analysis will be limited to movie-level trends such as overall genre popularity and total views. This means we will not be able to produce the more impactful insights requested by the client, such as what different user groups enjoy based on age, location, and subscription type.

### Data Cleaning Summary

As part of our review of the client-provided dataset, we identified and addressed a few data quality issues:

- **Missing values in Movie Title and Year:** Two entries were missing the Movie Title and Year. These entries were marked as "Unknown" so that they can be filtered from the analysis if needed.
- **Genre correction:** The genre label Dramatic appeared three times and was replaced for those films with more appropriate genre labels (Final Destination -> Horror, Schindler's List -> War & Drama, Gladiator -> Action & Drama).
- **Genre adjustment:** Scary Movie was labelled as "Comedy--Horror". This was split into Comedy and Horror, and the combined "Comedy-Horror" label was removed as it only appeared once in the dataset.
- **Spelling correction:** The genre value "Dramma" appeared in movie entries (Wonder Boys and Fargo) and was corrected to Drama.

### Clarifications Required

We noticed that the Language and Country fields appear to contain single values for each film, but some entries seem unusual or inconsistent. To ensure accurate interpretation of the dataset, could you please confirm whether these fields represent the original production details or whether they were simplified during data preparation?

**1. Language column**

Could you please confirm whether this column refers to the original audio language, subtitle language, or another format?

**2. Country column**

Could you please confirm whether this column refers to the country of production or another classification used in the dataset?

**3. Total Views column**

Are the total views recorded globally for each movie, or are they specific to each country listed?

We recommend that the missing user-level data be requested as a priority, as it will directly affect whether we can deliver the insights and dashboard expected by 1 July.

Kind regards,

Sabahat Naz

## [COMMS-06] Internal – New Datasets Received (Users & Ratings)
**Date:** 19/06/2026 10:45 AM
**From:** Bhanu Prakash `<b.prakash@datalens.com>`
**To:** da-team2
**Subject:** Re: Re: Fwd: StreamFlix Raw Data

Dear Team,

We have just received additional input from the client in the form of users.csv and ratings.csv datasets. As part of our Sprint 1 activities, please review and explore these files thoroughly.

Your key objectives are:

- Understand the structure and contents of both datasets.
- Identify primary keys, potential foreign keys, and relationships between tables.
- Assess data quality, completeness, and any anomalies.
- Document key observations and assumptions.
- Prepare recommendations that will support the schema design process.

Please ensure your analysis is completed and ready for discussion during our upcoming review session.

Kind regards,

> Hello!

> As requested, I am sharing the answers and instructions regarding the errors that you and your team have reported:
>
> 1. Mistake 1: Create a new YEAR column by extrapolating it from the Title column.
> 2. Mistake 2: The movie with the year "non_def" is from 1995.
> 3. Mistake 3: The untitled film is titled "The Phantom of the Opera".
> 4. Mistake 4: There is a movie whose genres are separated by "–" instead of "|" like the others. Please fix this error.
> 5. Mistake 5: There are 5 films in the Drama genre where the word "Drama" contains a spelling error in the Genre column. Please align them with the correct spelling.
>
> Please let me know if you have any further questions or require additional clarifications.

## [COMMS-08] Internal – Dataset Review Summary (Users & Ratings)
**Date:** 19/06/2026 02:30 PM
**From:** Andrew Chung `<a.chung@datalens.com>`
**To:** Bhanu Prakash `<b.prakash@datalens.com>`
**Cc:** da-team2
**Subject:** Update: DataLens Streaming Project: Data Limitations and Cleaning Summary

Dear Bhanu,

We have completed the initial review of the Users.csv and Ratings_Dataset.csv files as part of Sprint 1. Below is a summary of the key findings and assumptions for review:

- Users.csv contains 6,040 records and Ratings_Dataset.csv contains 10,000 records.
- UserID is the primary key for Users, and RatingID is the primary key for Ratings_Dataset.
- Ratings.UserID links to Users.UserID, and Ratings.MovieID links to the Movies table.
- The data supports a one-to-many relationship from Users to Ratings, and from Movies to Ratings.
- No missing values were found in the reviewed fields, and no duplicate full rows were identified.
- Rating values are within the expected range of 1–5.
- A number of UserID values in Ratings do not appear in Users; this should be confirmed as a referential integrity issue or a loading issue.
- The Timestamp column has a fixed time component of 04:32:50, so it should be treated as a date-level field rather than a full timestamp.
- The Users dataset appears complete across its descriptive fields, and the data is suitable for a star schema design with Ratings as the central fact table.
- If repeated ratings for the same user and movie are not intended, a uniqueness rule should be considered for (UserID, MovieID).

Please review and let us know if anything else should be added before we finalise the schema design discussion.

Kind regards,

Andrew Chung
